   <Image src={pic3} alt="" className="ml-[80px] mt-[50px]" />
   <p className="font-sans text-[17px] mt-[50px] w-[1000px] ml-[80px]">Encourage your child to explore different emotions by looking at facial expressions.

This activity is perfect for any climate throughout the fall and winter.</p>
   <p className="font-sans text-[30px] font-semibold ml-[50px] mt-[40px]">5. Picasso pumpkin</p>

Once it’s dry, your child will have a masterpiece ready to be shown at a museum.</p>

   <p className="font-sans text-[30px] font-semibold ml-[50px] mt-[40px]">8. Pumpkin treats</p>

   <p className="font-sans text-[17px] mt-[50px] w-[1000px] ml-[80px]">Don’t toss out your pumpkins just yet! Instead, create a fall mosaic with pumpkin seeds. Have your child arrange 50 dry seeds on a piece of paper in the shape of a pumpkin. They can also practice their math skills by counting how many seeds it takes to create the orange part of the pumpkin, the brown part for the stem, and the green for the leaf. Let your kids paint the seeds for each color and allow them to dry. Finally, glue them to a sheet of paper to complete their festive work of art!</p>
